# Product purpose

If you are looking for a secure chat application that provides reliable message delivery and strong data encryption, **WireChat** is designed to meet those needs. 

WireChat ensures that each service that is composing it is isolated and secure, while the use of Identity API provides user authentication and authorization. 

Additionally, the encryption of data in transit and the comprehensive logging system contribute to the overall security and transparency of the application.

While no system can guarantee "absolute security," WireChat aims to provide "sufficient security" to protect your data and maintain the integrity of your application.
